# FinaroExcercise

The mission is to create a program that receives a list of call times, each with a start and an end time.
The program will return the time interval of the busiest time of the day.

The way the program works:
1. Create one line of numbers- array with all the start and end times.
2. Goes over the line of numbers and find the longest series of start times before an end time comes.
This will represent the start time where the most call took place, and the end time will be when this time interval ends.
3. The specifics explained inside the code.
4. Tests are added to validate the program's performance
